# Undergraduate-Project
A repo containing all the relevant materials to view my undergrad coding project.

## Cellular Automata
The main focus of my project was to code and explore possible simulations using a computational model called Cellular Automata (See Project Report for more information). The project uses a Java library called Processing.js [https://processing.org/] , which would need to be downloaded to view the final results of the code.

## Road Network
The first Cellular Automata model I created models traffic moving on a road. This is detailed extensively in the project report.

## Virus Model
This Cellular Automata is 2D and models the spread of virus through a population
